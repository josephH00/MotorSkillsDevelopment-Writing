# MotorSkillsDevelopment-Writing
A game designed for repetitive fine motion training.

Based on p5.js (the Processing wrapper for JavaScript), this game (while standalone) was designed in conjunction with a set of other modules to be submitted as a project in my Introduction to Engineering class at Arizona State University.

## To Run
The game is designed to be integrated as a single .js file, the other files are included for organization and local development:
* Clone Repo
* Open index.html

All dependencies are included (local config files will be embedded into the .js in later builds)
